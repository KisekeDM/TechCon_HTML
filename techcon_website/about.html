            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
                TechCon began in 2012 as a local meetup for tech enthusiasts and has grown into a premier annual conference attended by innovators, developers, entrepreneurs, and thought leaders from across the globe. Over the years, it has evolved from a single-day workshop to a three-day immersive experience featuring keynotes, hands-on sessions, product expos, and networking events.

                From its humble beginnings in a university auditorium to selling out major convention centers, TechCon continues to foster collaboration and ignite forward-thinking innovation.
